# FusionPBX App Enhanced Dialplan Editor

This is a custom dialplan editor tool to give the ability to use nested conditionals, Side-by-side to the XML generated. This started out as a main project item but was rejected for use in the project, I have started to move this in to a dedicated side project application. More updates will come in the future.

#### Install
git clone https://github.com/frytimo/fusionpbx-app-enhanced_dialplan_editor /var/www/fusionpbx/app/enhanced_dialplan_editor
